# Fake News Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to classify news articles as either **fake** or **real** based on the text content. The goal is to detect fake news with high accuracy by training a model on labeled news datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset contains news articles, each labeled as **fake** or **real**. The text data is preprocessed and used to train the model.

## Project Structure

- `fake_news_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- `train.csv` – Dataset file
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## ML Approach

- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy
